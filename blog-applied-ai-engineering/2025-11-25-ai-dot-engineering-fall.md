This is a recap of the past few days at the AI conference, capturing my thoughts, what worked, what didn’t, and preparing to transition back to the real world.


What made this experience unusual was waiting for Kenton to decide on the Boston Career Fair. I had a feeling the Boston Career Fair would be a tough challenge this year, so I considered trying something different. Then, of course, the tickets sold out right after Kenton decided not to go—leaving me no choice but to volunteer. Kenton could have volunteered alone, but without guidance, I doubt it would’ve worked out, so I had to step in as well.


The experience was unique—like being a shark in a small pond. It also gave me a touch of imposter syndrome with the organizers, whom I greatly admire for their work in building such a strong community. I couldn’t bring myself to talk to them, which was disappointing. The role reversal was also interesting—like something out of “Undercover Boss,” where I felt like a junior employee, unable to make decisions or take the lead.


However, by the end, I did step up and take on a lot of leadership responsibilities, which I think the organizers appreciated, even if the higher-ups didn’t notice. From their perspective, I probably just seemed like someone who managed to hack his way in rather than pay the ticket price, and I can understand that.


The other volunteers were great—young AI enthusiasts early in their careers, likely in need of mentorship. That’s something I could see myself offering in the future. One of the education-focused attendees stood out, and I hope Kenton connects with him.


There were also interesting encounters at the OpenAI party, including a Japanese attendee and another person Kenton met who might help him find a job. I spent some time going through the network I’ve built over the past few days. Managing this growing list of contacts has been a bit of a challenge, but it’s been rewarding.


Since Monday, I’ve been incredibly busy, juggling several events and meetings. Some of the highlights included connecting with the GPX account team (who were fantastic), Hisamura-san, and Peter Akwaboa, the CEO of Benime—an absolute powerhouse. I also met Paul Scott from Morgan Stanley, Eduard Dumato, Angelo from Intel, and Sheldon C., who’s a hardware expert and reverse-engineers firmware, which I find fascinating.


Yoko Ito, a LinkedIn account director from Japan, wants to connect further, which is exciting. I also caught up with Matt Singer, who mentioned Roblox is moving away from Nomad, and Sam Machise, who’s now a cross-continent ninja. There were many other great people I met—engineers, founders, and AI innovators—who I plan to follow up with.


The broader takeaway from this experience was the humbling realization of spending three days as just another attendee before revealing my expertise. Selling my ideas and gaining traction was challenging, but I did receive valuable feedback.


It was great to see Kenta working the room, even though the experience was tough at times. The event was an opportunity to prove that being kind and positive can still lead to making meaningful connections and progress.
