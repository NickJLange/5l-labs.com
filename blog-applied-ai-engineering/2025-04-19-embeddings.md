The monetization strategy for private AI is evolving. Do we focus on hosting secure re-training servers, or is the value in providing 'Private Models' as a service? Alternatively, perhaps a data-privacy-first exchange allows for anonymized datasets to be contributed back to the collective model in exchange for reduced costs.

How do frameworks like [Flower](https://flower.ai/) fit into this? Flower allows for easy federated learning, enabling local agents to contribute to a larger model without sharing raw, sensitive data. This fits perfectly with the vision of private agency, where personal data stays local while the global model improves.

### Pim Particles: The Dimensions of Semantic Meaning

The "Pim Particles" metaphor describes how embeddings compress high-dimensional semantic space into a manageable vector format. Just as Pim Particles allow objects to shrink and grow while maintaining their fundamental properties, embeddings map complex human language into a lower-dimensional space that AI models can efficiently process.

Different Dimensions - what does this mean? In embeddings, "dimensions" refer to the number of numerical features used to represent a piece of text. A 1536-dimensional vector (common for models like OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small`) captures 1536 different semantic "facets" of the data, allowing for highly nuanced similarity searches.
