The monetization strategy for private AI in the home is still in its infancy. Do we monetize the orchestration server for private re-training? Or is the value in the "Private Models" themselves? Alternatively, perhaps a data-privacy-first exchange allows for anonymized datasets to be contributed back to the collective in exchange for lower hardware overhead.

### Mini Minds: The Power of Local Collaboration

The "Mini Minds" concept involves using multiple small language models (SLMs), each specialized for a specific task—like intent detection, light control, or temperature monitoring—rather than one monolithic LLM. This approach reduces latency and compute costs while maintaining high accuracy in a local IoT environment.

### How do Federated Learning Frameworks fit in?

Frameworks like [Flower](https://flower.ai/) are essential for this "Mini Minds" architecture. They allow multiple local devices to participate in training without sharing raw, sensitive data, enabling a collective intelligence that stays within the home's walls. This interoperability between small, specialized models is the key to a truly responsive and private smart home.
