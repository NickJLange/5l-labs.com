# Bolt's Journal

This journal documents critical performance learnings for the 5L Labs project.

## 2026-02-22 - Font Loading Optimization
**Learning:** Using `preconnect` for `fonts.gstatic.com` significantly improves FCP by establishing the connection early.
**Action:** Always include `preconnect` links for external font providers in `docusaurus.config.js`.

## 2026-02-22 - Static Image Formats
**Learning:** The Docusaurus React setup efficiently handles direct WebP imports in `src/pages/index.js`, dropping the hero banner LCP image payload by ~85% (233KB -> 35KB) without needing additional Webpack loader configurations.
**Action:** Default to `.webp` formats for large static UI elements (like logos or hero images) rather than `.png`.

## 2025-05-24 - Client-side Markdown Rendering for Static Previews
**Learning:** Using client-side markdown parsers (like react-markdown) for static content previews significantly increases bundle size unnecessarily. Processing markdown to plain text or HTML at build time is a much more efficient strategy for static site generators.
**Action:** Always check if content transformation can be moved to the build step before importing heavy runtime libraries.

## 2025-10-26 - Implicit Dependency Upgrades with Bun
**Learning:** `bun install` may implicitly upgrade major versions of dependencies (e.g., React 18 to 19) if `package.json` ranges allow it and the lockfile isn't respected or is regenerated. This can cause massive, out-of-scope diffs.
**Action:** Always verify `bun.lock` diffs after installation. Revert lockfile changes if they are not intended.

## 2025-05-24 - Hero Image Optimization & CLS
**Learning:** Large unoptimized images in the hero section are a primary cause of slow LCP and CLS. Providing explicit `width` and `height` attributes to the `img` tag, even if overridden by CSS, allows the browser to reserve the correct aspect ratio space immediately.
**Action:** Always optimize hero images (compress/resize) and define explicit dimensions to prevent layout shifts.

## 2026-02-23 - Python HTTP Connection Pooling
**Learning:** Using standalone `requests.get()` and `requests.post()` in a loop to fetch multiple URLs or hit an API causes a new TCP/TLS handshake per request, leading to massive latency overhead for large jobs.
**Action:** Always refactor iterative network operations to use a shared `requests.Session()` passed down via arguments to implement Keep-Alive connection pooling.

## 2023-10-27 - Caching Network I/O
**Learning:** For batch processing scripts that perform slow network I/O or downstream API calls, not checking if the work has already been done on previous runs leads to redundant requests and N times the API cost.
**Action:** Always check local file system state (e.g., using `.exists()` on the target output path) and skip operations like fetching remote content if the result is already available locally.

## 2026-02-23 - Memoizing React Render Computations
**Learning:** In Docusaurus React pages, synchronous list filtering (like iterating through large `allPosts` arrays) on every render is an unnecessary bottleneck when routing causes unrelated state/location changes.
**Action:** Always wrap derived list computations in `useMemo` when the source array is static or infrequently changing, ensuring filtering only fires when the specific dependency (like a filter category) updates.

## 2023-10-27 - React Render Loop Optimization
**Learning:** Avoid instantiating new arrays (e.g. `['class1', condition ? 'class2' : ''].filter(Boolean).join(' ')`) on every render when constructing dynamic CSS class strings in React components, as this creates unnecessary garbage collection pressure in hot paths.
**Action:** Always favor template literal strings (e.g. `` `class1${condition ? ' class2' : ''}` ``) for conditional class names to prevent intermediate object allocations.

## 2023-10-27 - Caching Array Search Results in React
**Learning:** Performing O(N) array search operations (like `.find()`) inside a React render function without memoization can cause performance degradation, especially if the search depends on state that might not change between all renders.
**Action:** Always wrap derived list computations and searches in `useMemo` when the source array is static or infrequently changing.

## 2026-02-23 - Cascading Re-renders from Root CSS State
**Learning:** Storing CSS-only state (like UI density, accent colors, or hidden annotations) at the root of a large unmemoized component tree (like `PreviewApp.jsx`) causes expensive cascading re-renders of heavy static child components (`CanvasView`, `Manifesto`, etc.) every time the state changes, even if the children don't depend on that state directly.
**Action:** When implementing root-level state that only drives CSS class toggles, always wrap heavy, static child components in `React.memo()` and provide stable function references via `useCallback()` to prevent them from needlessly re-rendering.
## 2024-07-19 - Hoisting Static Variables in React

**Learning:** Static arrays, objects, and strings defined inside a React component's render function (like `buttons` or `gridSvg`) are re-created on every single render. In heavy components or those that re-render frequently (e.g., in a preview environment or when user tweaking state updates the root class), this causes unnecessary memory allocation and garbage collection churn. A local benchmark showed a ~62% execution time improvement just by moving object creation out of a hot loop.

**Action:** Always inspect functional components for static configuration objects, arrays, and template strings that don't depend on props or state. Hoist them out of the component to the module level. Ensure you prefix with comments (e.g. `// ⚡ Bolt Perf: ...`) to explain why they are outside the component.
