These blog entries are not getting enough care and feeding to be fully fleshed out statements, and instead have become a set of working notes. For 2026, we'll look to change that situation slowly. You may see existing entries updated after publishing to make them more polished and accessible.

# Predictions for 2026

Last year, we did not set out any predictions formally which make it hard to hold ourselves accountable despite many promising areas getting fleshed out. Let's change that. 

## Area 1: Token Efficiency through automated Teacher / Student structures

As Infrastructure continues to get built out, the costs to distill should hopefully drop which open a different door to private AI  

## Area 2: Small Language Models



## Area 3: Data Relationships via Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Data management

## Area 4: Signal improvement through manual clustering of weights/embeddings

## Area 5: Automated Weight Augmentation for Language Models (Mr. Potatohead)
