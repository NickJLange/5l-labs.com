It's easy to get wrapped up in the day-to-day and feel that depression that long-term work is not moving forward. It's happened a couple of times now that in those moments two things are required:

1. Some distance from work
2. Luck

In this case, that's exactly what happened. While strolling through the backstreets of Akihabara, I came across the fine people of [Aisan Electric (愛三電気株式会社)](https://www.aisan.co.jp/index.html) who sell common-sense solutions for data centers and networking hobbyists, such as:

1. A 24/7 SFP vending machine—absolute magic for those middle-of-the-night hardware emergencies!
2. A handheld copper connectivity tester that spits out received VLANs and can ping gateways instantly.
3. A wide array of RFID equipment, which is an established technology that can cover really small devices at range.

### Serendipity at the Edge

This got me thinking about "passive" home automation—using RFID tags on non-powered items (like a specific coffee mug or a set of keys) to trigger local AI agents when they are "seen" by a reader. It’s a low-energy, privacy-preserving way to add context to a private AI assistant without cameras or battery-powered sensors.

This kind of serendipity—finding a solution to a problem you weren't actively solving—is only possible when you step away from the keyboard and into the "real" world of physical hardware and different cultural approaches to tech. Akihabara remains a pilgrimage site for anyone looking to reconnect with the tangible side of engineering.
