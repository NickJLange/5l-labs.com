# Wrangling MCP for TOIL reduction

#### Prerequisite thoughts
 * Private agents are the key to maintaining a cloud-free home without the burden of a second full-time IT job.
 * We're not going to AGI soon, but we *can* automate the mundane.

## What is the problem I am solving?

When describing my cloud-free internet set up at home, a distinguished former manager congratulated me on my pro-bono secondary IT job and wondered how I'd find the time. As I was still in the honeymoon phase and having fun, I generally dismissed the comment.

A few years on, the risk of "set-it-and-forget-it" is real. Recent advances in machine learning make it easier to lower the burden of keeping code up to date at home, but they rely on public cloud LLMs to operate, which brings up issues with data privacy, sovereignty, and security.

## How I am thinking about MCP / Coding Assistants and Private Agents

**PSA**: A continued shout to the fine folks at [Latent Space](https://discord.gg/XVfBxerR)—their Thursday Paper Chats and Friday AI In Action talks are a great way for busy people to stay up to date on the latest developments.

### Can we leverage machine learning and natural language to put "no code" wrappers in front of home-based services?

My first reaction to the [deep dive into MCP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQmXtrmQ5Zg) during the AI.engineer summit in NY was that it was just API-wrapping fluff; however, I quickly realized that if done right, the real value of MCP could be using Natural Language as the "truth" for the MCP Server/Client code, independent of the underlying API. Assuming we can solve for the "crazy uncle" problem of LLMs:

1. **Re-vibe Strategy**: Keep just the "Generator" Language and a `.patch` file in the repo. This allows the LLM to "re-vibe" the server code from scratch whenever the underlying API changes, applying our custom logic as a surgical patch.
2. **Agentic Pipeline**: Use a Mixture of Experts (MoE) Strategist/Teacher/Student pipeline to update the MCP Client/Server Hooks.
3. **Regression Testing**: Use actual previous calls to perform regression testing.
4. **Automated Release**: Update the repo and trigger a release automatically.

At this point in time, I do not see an easy way to do this work with an open-source LLM (yet!), but perhaps with enough models generated in this framework, that could change.

In our next post, we'll dive into "Pim Particles" and how to shrink these models to fit on a Raspberry Pi 4.
