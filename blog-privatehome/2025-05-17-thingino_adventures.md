- Wyze integrates and resells IoT cameras and devices for low capital cost, and has been under investor pressure to generate more monthly recurring revenue (missing source)
- In addition, your data goes to the Wyze Cloud Infra on AWS where mistakes have happened.
  - I'm not judging, but I am if you are walking around naked (or worse) in from of a wyze product.
- I'm not opposed to regularly paying Wyze for continuing to identify and bring promising solutions to the US from Shenzhen, BUT
  - I'm already paying Apple and Google - do I really need to pay wyze?
- Scrypted and Frigate started as open source Private IoT Camera management software  - streaming on the local lan via ovnif
- They both work with the Wyze API, but Wyze recently change their firmware to force
